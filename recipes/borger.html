        <p>Well look no further! Here at Abdul's Foodies Inc. we've concocted the most scientifically perfect recipe for that very burger!</p>

            (or at least unitl you want it again ;)
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp. of pink himalayan salt</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp. of ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 lb. of ground beef</li>
            <li>0.5 cup of fine dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Lettuce (To personal serving)</li>
            <li>Tomatoes (Maximum of 2 slices/burger)</li>
            <li>Onions (Maximum of 4 evenly sized rings)</li>
            <li>McDonalds store bought secret sauce</li>
            <li>Brioche buns</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground 
                beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties</li>
            <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C)</li>    
            <li>Fresh off the grill transfer your patties to the bottom of our golden brown toasted brioche bun</li>
            <li>Lather a healthy serving of the store bought secret sauce. I prefer 1 tbsp. but to each his own</li>
            <li>Stack our lettuce leaf(s), onion ring(s), and tomato slices on top</li>
            <li>And finally top of with the second hald of our golden brown toasted brioche bun</li>
        </ol>
