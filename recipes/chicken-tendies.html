        <h3>Desciption</h3>
        <p>Ever feel like a fatty that has accomplished nothing in life and just wants to indulge in the art of stress eating for a moment?</p>
        <p>Well in order to fulfill such a glutonous desire you need a food befitting of being the poster child for deep fried goodness.</p>
        <p>There's no other food that fulfills this description except for our world famous (subjective) chicken tenders of course.</p>
        <p>The only thing more comforting would be fried butter but you're mildly overweight not obsese so we'll save that for when you've had enough of this mid life :(</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 lbs. of chicken tenders or 2 large boneless, skinless, chicken breasts. (sliced)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>0.75 tsp. of salt</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten with 2 tbsp. of water</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a cast iron or standard skillet with approximately 2 inches of oil</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt and pepper</li>
            <li>In another large bowl, beat the egg and water</li>
            <li>Dredge the chicken in the flour, coating well. Shake off excess flour and dip in the egg, then back in the flour</li>
            <li>Set the chicken to the side to rest approximatelt 5 minutes (helps the coating stick better)</li>
            <li>When oil temperature is steady between 365-375 you may begin laying in the coated tenders</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken for 8-10 minutes on each side. Golden brown bread is a good indicator of when to flip</li>
            <li>Transfer to a paper towel and optionally sprinkle with MSG while sizzling hot</li>
        </ol>
